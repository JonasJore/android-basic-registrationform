# android-basic-registrationform

A very simple registrationform using basic xml-based android layout.   
The purpose of this project is for me to learn how old xml-based android apps are built

The registrationform at this point used `findViewById` manually for every view in the
user-interface. I know there is a way of using two-way-databinding in the xml-layout for this, but i
have not learned how that works yet.
